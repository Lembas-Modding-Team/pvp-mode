/**
 * This event has to be fired every time the configuration property values of a
 * registered configuration property will be changed, also, when the properties
 * were reloaded and the new values aren't equal to the old ones. It doesnâ€™t have
 * to be fired if the property value was changed before it can be accessed by
 * components outside of the configuration environment, for example directly
 * after the properties have been reloaded in the
 * {@link ConfigurationManager#load()} function. It will be fired too when the
 * configuration is loaded for the first time. In that case the old value is
 * null
