# This file lists all biome and alignment dependent overrides, forcing PvP mode to OFF when conditions are met.
#
# Basically this file allows you to specify in which biome a player which is aligned to a faction you assign to this biome is forced to have PvP disabled.
# Also, you can define what "aligned" means (in terms of alignment): If the alignment of the player is greater than the specified one, the player is seen as aligned.
#
# One can include multiple lines starting with the same faction, but with different alignment values. That way you can specify different alignment conditions for different biomes, but for the same faction
# Note that if you specify two entries with the same faction, but different alignment values, for the same biome, the condition with the lowest alignment value applies.
#
# A configuration entry consists of one line, which contains three columns separated by a semicolon (;).
#
# The first part is the faction name, which is the name which is internally used by the game (see the command /alignment). Also you can use the specifier ALL,
# which means that every player, regardless of his alignment, is forced to have PvP disabled on the specified biomes.
#
# The second part is the minimum required alignment (see above). If the specified faction is ALL, the alignment value will be ignored (but has to be a valid number).
#
# The third part is a comma-separated list of biome ids where the specified condition applies.
# A complete list of all Biome ID numbers is provided in LOTRmod_biomeids.txt in the main directory.
#
# If this file is deleted, it'll be recreated with default configuration data.
# On startup you'll see in the logs if the mod found errors in this file - then you can fix them.
#
# Some words to the file format: 
# Comments cover a whole line, which must start with a #. The PvP Mode Mod will ignore them.
# Blank lines and spaces will be ignored too - you can put as much spaces between the configuration entries as you want.
