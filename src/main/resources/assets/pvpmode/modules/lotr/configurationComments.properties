enemy_biome_overrides_enabled=If true, the PvP mode enemy biome override condition for LOTR biomes will be enabled. Players who are an enemy of a faction are forced to have PvP enabled while they're in a biome which is clearly assignable to that faction. This is highly configurable.
fast_traveling_while_pvp_blocked=If enabled, players cannot use the LOTR fast travel system while they're in PvP.
player_skulls_always_dropped=If true, players killed with a weapon with the headhunting modifier will drop their skulls even with keepInventory enabled.
safe_biome_overrides_enabled=If true, the PvP mode safe override condition for LOTR biomes will be enabled, which has a higher priority than the enemy override condition. Players who are aligned with a faction are forced to have PvP disabled while they're in a biome which is clearly assignable to that faction. This can also be applied without the alignment criterion. This is highly configurable.
faction_placeholders=Allows the specification placeholders, which collect factions and eventually other placeholders under one name. Placeholders are declared in the format "name=values", where "values" is a comma-separated list of faction and/or placeholder names. A placeholder name must only contain underscores and uppercase letters, and it mustn't be empty or equal to a faction name. References to non-existing or invalid placeholders or invalid placeholders in general will be removed. If circular references between placeholders are detected, as much as necessary placeholders or references to break the circle will be removed. Warnings will be logged for all invalid specifications.
gear_items_blocked=If true, the gear item blocking system will be enabled, which will block the usage of certain gear items (armor, weapons and other items) for players, mostly alignment based. Blocked items can't be used for combat, and they can't be right-clicked. Blocked armor items also provide no protection, altough certain features still could work, if the armor item is just equipped (for example, Galvorn armor would still protect one from arrows). Additional features which prohibit this can be enabled via the other configuration options. Which items will be blocked can be configured in the gear item blocking configuration file. The gear item blocking doesn't apply to players in creative mode.
#item_usage_blocked_messages=A message in this list will be randomly chosen and displayed to a player who tries to use a blocked item. If it's empty, the default messages will be used. Duplicated entries and blank lines will be ignored.
item_usage_blocked_message_cooldown=The cooldown, after which chat messages will be displayed, if blocked items were used. Use -1 to not display any warnings.
armor_inventory_check_interval=The interval between the checks for blocked armor items in a player's armor inventory. If the armor inventory contains blocked items, the player will receive a warning, and eventually, the armor items will be removed (look at the other configuration options). Use -1 to disable the checks.
blocked_armor_remove_timer=The timer, after which blocked armor items will be removed from the player's armor inventory. The timer will start with the armor inventory check that discovered these blocked items. Use -1 to disable the removal of the items. The remove action can be specified with other configuration options. If the armor inventory checks are already disabled, the value of this configuration option is irrelevant.
armor_remove_action=The action that will be used to remove blocked armor items which do not fit in the player's inventory. Use 0 to just drop the item on the ground at the player's position, or use 1, to store the item in a hidden inventory. Players can claim these items again by executing the "/pvpvault claim" command.
equipping_of_blocked_armor_blocked=If true, the game will block players from equipping blocked armor items. Because this block can be bypassed with features of other mods (intentionally or unintentionally), we recommend to also enable the armor inventory checks and the armor item removal, if players really shouldn't be able to equip blocked armor.
