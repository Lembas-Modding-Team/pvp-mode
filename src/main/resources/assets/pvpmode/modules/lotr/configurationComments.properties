enemy_biome_overrides_enabled=If true, the PvP mode enemy biome override condition for LOTR biomes will be enabled. Players who are an enemy of a faction are forced to have PvP enabled while they're in a biome which is clearly assignable to that faction. This is highly configurable.
fast_traveling_while_pvp_blocked=If enabled, players cannot use the LOTR fast travel system while they're in PvP.
player_skulls_always_dropped=If true, players killed with a weapon with the headhunting modifier will drop their skulls even with keepInventory enabled.
safe_biome_overrides_enabled=If true, the PvP mode safe override condition for LOTR biomes will be enabled, which has a higher priority than the enemy override condition. Players who are aligned with a faction are forced to have PvP disabled while they're in a biome which is clearly assignable to that faction. This can also be applied without the alignment criterion. This is highly configurable.
faction_placeholders=Allows the specification placeholders, which collect factions and eventually other placeholders under one name. Placeholders are declared in the format "name=values", where "values" is a comma-separated list of faction and/or placeholder names. A placeholder name must only contain underscores and uppercase letters, and it mustn't be empty or equal to a faction name. References to non-existing or invalid placeholders or invalid placeholders in general will be removed. If circular references between placeholders are detected, as much as necessary placeholders or references to break the circle will be removed. Warnings will be logged for all invalid specifications.
