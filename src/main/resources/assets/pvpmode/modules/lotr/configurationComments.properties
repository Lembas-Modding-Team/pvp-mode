enemy_biome_overrides_enabled=If true, the PvP mode enemy biome override condition for LOTR biomes will be enabled. Players who are an enemy of a faction are forced to have PvP enabled while they're in a biome which is clearly assignable to that faction. This is highly configurable.
fast_traveling_while_pvp_blocked=If enabled, players cannot use the LOTR fast travel system while they're in PvP.
player_skulls_always_dropped=If true, players killed with a weapon with the headhunting modifier will drop their skulls even with keepInventory enabled.
safe_biome_overrides_enabled=If true, the PvP mode safe override condition for LOTR biomes will be enabled, which has a higher priority than the enemy override condition. Players who are aligned with a faction are forced to have PvP disabled while they're in a biome which is clearly assignable to that faction. This can also be applied without the alignment criterion. This is highly configurable.
