#
# This file lists all biome and alignment dependent overrides, forcing PvP mode to ON when conditions are met.
#
# Basically this file allows you to specify in which biome a player which is hostile to a faction you assign to this biome is forced to have PvP enabled.
# Also, you can define what "hostile" means (in terms of alignment): If the alignment of the player is less than the specified one, the player is seen as hostile.
#
# A configuration entry consists of one line, which contains three columns separated by a semicolon (;).
#
# The first part is the faction name, which is the name which is internally used by the game (see the command /alignment). Also you can use the specifier ALL,
# which means that every player, regardless of his alignment, is forced to have PvP enabled on the specified biomes.
#
# The second part is the minimum required alignment (see above). If the specified faction is ALL, the alignment value will be ignored (but has to be a valid number).
#
# The third part is a comma-separated list of biome ids where the specified condition applies.
# A complete list of all Biome ID numbers is provided in LOTRmod_biomeids.txt in the main directory.
#
# If this file is deleted, it'll be recreated with default configuration data.
# On startup you'll see in the logs if the mod found errors in this file - then you can fix them.
#
# Some words to the file format: 
# Comments cover a whole line, which must start with a #. The PvP Mode Mod will ignore them.
# Blank lines and spaces will be ignored too - you can put as much spaces between the configuration entries as you want.
